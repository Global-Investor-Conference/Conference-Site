                                <p>In this session we are so fortunate to have Janine Firpo, Dr Ruth Shaber and Sheila Shroeder in dialogue discussing the differences in how men and women traditionally think about investing, spending money, saving money, money in general and how this might affect our lives and our relationships.     

                                    Given that 45% of marriages end in divorce in the US, and money issues are the No. 1 thing that couples argue about, this is a worthy conversation to have. Numerous studies have identified disagreements over finances as one of the top reasons couples seek marital counseling, as well as one of the top reasons for divorce. And we know that families are often reluctant to talk about money with their children, but experts say that can create confusion and insecurity. So thankfully, they’re going to share how to successfully engage in financial conversations and collaboration with partners, parents, children, and others.  
                                    
                                    However, it's not a secret that people involved in committed relationships tend to perform well, maybe even better, financially. Can a stable relationship help you achieve your financial goals? Ultimately, money can either build or break relationships so how can we make sure we avoid the later? After this conversation we expect to come out with a better understanding and a clear mindset of what’s actually important and what we should pay attention to keep building relationships instead of breaking them, after all relationships and money tend to come hand-in-hand.

                                <p>On the 19th of January at 9am we kick of 2023 with our Women Investor Series. This is an investor focused event geared towards women investors and investors keen to invest in women. Women have been under-represented in private equity for as long as the industry has been around. Our mission here at Linqto is to democratize private investing, but there is a large section of eligible investors not participating in the private markets: women. We launched this to both investigate the problem and empower women with financial literacy and democratize access to experts and investments. We also want to understand the challenges faced by women in the tech industry, both on the operating side and on the financing side. 

                                    As such we bring in the best and encourage YOUR attendance so we can propel this movement forward.

                                    Let’s call a Spade a Spade – these are scary times; rising inflation, rising interest rates, a war, a global pandemic, unstable supply chains. These are incredibly challenging market conditions. There seems also to be a lot of mixed signals on the economy. Are we going into recession? What’s consumer spending signaling? The data seems to be all over the map. Meanwhile, there’s technological disruption left, right and center. So, what, WHAT, does this mean for investors? What do you do? 

There’s also opportunity in any emerging crisis. It’s understandable to be concerned and so it’s time to look for answers to how the private markets behave in downturns. Historically private equity has done well for those who don’t retreat but rather continue allocating. Private Equity (PE) generated some of its best performing vintages during the dot com crash of 2001 and the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, according to Pitchbook data. The same cannot be said of returns at hedge funds, which have been pedestrian at best and while banks have been tied up in regulatory knots. 

That’s not to say PE doesn’t have fault lines! They also have well-known problems; overvaluation, optimistic assumptions, aggressive accounting and high debt levels. Due diligence during these times are therefore key, lest you become collateral from opaque valuations – after being valued in 2021 at $46bn, a 2022 $800m funding round valued Klarna at $ 6.7bn, that’s an 85% fall. However, there’s opportunity on the table.  

But whilst markets are in shock let’s discuss our long-term game plan. Because as the historical data proves, putting money to work during market downturns produces higher returns on average than during upcycles. We need to zone in on innovation, sector focus and diversification potentials. In this Linqto Learn we’re going to discuss strategies and theses to address this collapsing macro-economic framework. We’re going to be doing that with no other than Holly Ruxin.

                            		<iframe width="852" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-SJL_fcdTY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                                    Emerging-market multinational companies now make up approximately one-third of the Fortune Global 500. Through a combination of growth in their domestic markets, greenfield investments, and mergers and acquisitions, they have moved into the top league in several industries. They have also turned key innovators and technological leaders and, in the process, become major competitors for their Western counterparts.

What has fuelled these companies’ growth? Because there’s a huge difference between growing a unicorn in an emerging market vs in North America. For starters, asset classes like venture capital are not as well developed. Capital is limited and access to international capital is hard, so investors and venture capitalists can be more selective; they can ask for revenue even at early stages and pressure start-ups for improbable results. At the same time early adopters are not that easy to come by, having a smaller middle class means that there’s less disposable income which leads to fewer risk takers, so trying something new could even be a luxury.

What’s changing? Before the technology and connectivity boom, emerging markets were dominated by traditional businesses growing at a steady pace. However, access to the internet brought with it a new set of opportunities and the extraordinary ability to scale companies by reaching across geographies to customers around the world. Certain enablers make emerging markets particularly ripe for disruptive technologies. The first is high mobile adoption and internet access. Latin America had 77% smartphone adoption in 2021, which is projected to reach 82% by 2025. It is unlikely to be a coincidence that one of the most remarkable transformations appears to be underway in India, a country that in the space of five years went from having one of the worst mobile internet infrastructures in the world to one of the best, and now also boasts the largest and fastest-growing open digital payments infrastructure in the world: last year India produced more unicorns than anywhere else in the world apart from the US and China (and based on the numbers so far this year, the country has leapfrogged China into second place). Then there’s Africa where Fintech unicorns are thriving. On the first 7 months of this year, African fintech companies have raised close to US$1.5 billion against US$ 1.06 billion raised across 2011 to 2020. This is a clear indication of accelerated interest in the market and the potential for fintech’s in Africa.  

What business models are going strong in emerging markets? How is DeFi empowering emerging markets. We sit down with the experts to find out what’s going on and why all eyes should be on Africa.

                                    How do we get from Web2 to Web3? It is not one huge leap, it is a hop, skip and jump and an ongoing transition where not only innovators play a key role but also iterators take the lead. As we start to see companies being funded, developed and growing we look closely at their revenue models and what they do to differentiate between the ones that are just following the trend and the ones that will become legacy companies.  

How can we know if they have a long-term viable product? Where does the product value come from? Is it sustainable to be dependent on community and engagement? Can they be responsive and quick-moving to keep up with the latest competitors? What use case are they solving? And, most important, will they prevail? 

These have always been important questions, but as we move into Web3 the answers might be different. NFT’s value, for example, depends on community and community engagement, will this permeate into other technologies or will this use case fail? In a different but similar way, gaming also depends on community, will this be a use case where a specific group’s engagement adds enough value for a company to thrive?  

As we try to build the bridge to Web3 we are looking at many things, lately the most highlighted ones are: identity, infrastructure, security, and regulation. There’s been so many iterations in this space that when we look back, we feel like we’ve been down this road for much longer than what it's actually been. But we are still uncovering new use cases, new upgrades and new properties that will be needed to transition from niche to mainstream.

                                <p>Family Offices and investors around the world are adapting to a new era, one where high inflation, rising interest rates, and disrupted supply chains are forcing them to review their investment options. For positive thinkers, we can agree that the environment we’re in is a good opportunity to reconsider strategic asset allocation. But what does this mean exactly? According to The Global Family Office Report 2022, family offices are shifting from fixed income allocations to investments in private equity, real estate, and private debt. In other words, they are sacrificing liquidity for returns. Why?  

                                    As family offices increase their allocations in the private market, what are they looking at? What are they evaluating? And how do they mitigate risk? Usually, the implications of inflation can be evaluated with the historical correlation of assets, from gold to real estate. However, today we have new assets in the picture: cryptocurrencies and blockchain, as well as a growing focus on impact investment and ESG. So, what are family office thoughts on these types of investments moving forward?</p>

                                <p>The shift to digital payments and money transfers has been evident for the best part of 10 years. But you’d be surprised to hear that digital payments actually date back to 1997 when Coca-Cola introduced a few vending machines in Helsinki that allowed consumers to buy a can via text message. Of course, that’s a far cry from today’s digital crypto wallet, but nevertheless, a genesis. So, what happened in between and where are we at today? In this Linqto Learn we dive into the evolution of digital wallets, what’s driving the change, what we have today and where the technology is going next.</p>

As you know, during these sessions, we focus on empowering women with financial literacy and access to experts and investments. This is an opportunity for ALL to learn. This time we’ll be sitting down with two prominent women whose vast experience will guide anyone interested in private equity investing: Linda P Jones and Erica Lill.
 
                                    Erica Lill is an advisor to CEO’s and family offices primarily on early stage and crypto investing, she has over 25 years of investor experience and has helped foster growth and success in over 30 companies. Linda P Jones is an author, podcaster, and entrepreneur. She is the CEO of Be Wealthy & Smart VIP Experience where she shows how to invest in stocks and digital assets for financial security and independence.
                                     
                                    How did they get there? How do they decide when and which company/startup to invest in? What do they consider when making this decision? What are family offices looking at today? What asset classes should we be thoughtful of? Investing, in general, can be overwhelming so why not learn from someone who’s not only gone through this unknown path but has succeeded in doing so.
                                    
                                    This is your chance! Having these incredible women together will certainly shed a light in a sometimes-intimidating but highly profitable market. </p>

                                <p>Equity compensation is non-cash pay that is offered to employees. It may be options, restricted stock, or performance shares; these investment vehicles represent ownership in the firm for a company’s employees. It allows the employee to share in the profits via appreciation and can encourage retention, particularly if vesting requirements exist. But what happens when you exercise your options? What are the tax implications? When should you exercise your options? What should you consider?

                                    So what are the paths to liquidity? Aside from IPO, Acquisition, Direct Listing, SPAC. There’s also selling your private shares to a buyer. What are the tax implications here? What of ROFR? Do you need company approval?
                                    
                                    We will be sitting down with Alva Fuller, Marcel Pfister, and Phillip Duckworth from wealth management company Farther to discuss pre and post-liquidity planning and fully understand the processes and paths to liquidity.</p>

                                    Blockchain technology has been one of the biggest innovations of the 21st century. Since as early as 2014, companies have been using blockchain to improve their operations; it has proven to be essential in companies of all types and sizes, worldwide and across all industries.

                                    We’ve come a long way since blockchain’s early days, and we still have a long way to go. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global blockchain market is projected to grow from USD 7.18 billion in 2022 to USD 163.83 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 56.3% during the forecast period. It is definitely not something you want to keep on the back burner.
                                    
                                    As the industry has grown immensely, so have the experts in it, and Dr. Elizabeth Lewis has immensely stood out within this group. She is a physician innovator and general partner at Crypto VCF, a venture capital firm supporting blockchain. She’s an international crypto and blockchain speaker with vast experience in leading innovations such as MedTech, SportsTech, and Gaming.
                                    
                                    We will sit down with her to talk about what awaits the world by using and adopting blockchain. What is blockchain scalability? What are the limitations, the costs? What are sidechains? What is the blockchain trilemma or the issues developers are facing? And most importantly, how can we overcome them?
                                </p>

                                <p>Due Diligence, where does one begin? When considering an investment, proper due diligence gives you the perspective you need before deciding to act. But, what exactly is due diligence? And why do you as an investor need to get to grips with it?

                                    We’re continuing our women investor series, which is all about empowering women with financial literacy and access to experts and investments, with a deep dive session on Due Diligence with Kerry Leigh Miller. Kerry Leigh Miller is co-founder and general partner at Overton Venture Capital, a VC with a sweet spot for marketplaces and next-generation consumer brands.
                                    
                                    At its simplest, due diligence is an investigation to collect critical information about an investment - it’s one of the most important workflows for any investment professional. The due diligence process will explore and confirm details of a company in an effort to uncover and mitigate potential risks in an investment decision. Not only will the due diligence process lead an investor or buyer to pursue or drop a deal it will lay the foundation for structuring the deal if you decide to move forward. Making an investment decision and assessing the potential risks of that investment rely heavily on having accurate information. Good due diligence will evaluate the many risk factors that pertain to an investment. Proper due diligence includes investigating the previous and current performance of an entity, as well as the market to gauge future growth and potential returns.
                                    
                                    But it’s more than just a financial audit, it’s an investigation into the many different moving parts of a company, and Kerry is here to walk us through it all… Kerry is an inspiration and a powerhouse of a woman and we highly recommend you come loaded with questions for her.</p>

                                <p>Did you know in the last ten years, the marketing technology space has grown by nearly 6521%? That’s staggering. Do you know what MarTech is? It’s where marketing and technology intersect. Why do we need to know about it? Well, it’s a $345bn market. In short, it’s a BIG deal.

                                    Only a few years ago, MarTech was in its infancy. Today, it’s a vital tool for marketers. Thanks to big data, AI, and machine learning, every aspect of a marketers’ job is happening at scale, in a multi-touchpoint, omnichannel, primarily digital environment.
                                    
                                    Then add in COVID. COVID massively accelerated e-commerce. As we all sat at home in lockdowns, our online spending went right up. 93% of buyers changed their shopping behaviors to online. In 2021, nearly all marketing programs went fully digital. 29% of buyers say they won’t return to shopping in person again. Then, of course, there’s social media shopping; personalized delivery of ads, products, and messaging - it’s a race to do this best.
                                    
                                    This Linqto Learn, we’re sitting down with Janis Spivack, MarTech guru. Janis is a catalytic navigator; she helps businesses move through change. And she does it very well. From the traditional world of advertising to taking part in the very first virtual world in, yes, 1993. From helping build some of the very first big commercial websites like Macys.com and DaimlerChrysler.com, cars.com, to helping Nike.com assemble the right team and logistics to build a sustainable e-commerce presence - Janis has seen it all. She is Chief Experience Officer, the hired gun to go in and build prototypes for companies that need to make a change. And we are going to sit and learn it all from her.
                                    
                                    We’ll find out about how everyone else competes with Amazon. We’ll find out what exactly a digital experience platform is. We’ll discuss the biggest challenges facing CMOs. We’ll sift through the noise and workout what investors should know and look out for in this space. And we’ll look to the future and map out what we should be excited about and fear right now…
                                    
                                    This is going to be a fast session, so whether you’re a creative, an investor, or an entrepreneur, this is going to be a ride.</p>

                                <p>Digital assets are inherently valuable, which means they are attractive not only to their owner but to others as well. As cryptocurrency ownership rises, cyber security knowledge should as well. During this Linqto Learn we will sit down with Alexander Delossantos and Tony Edward to talk about basic security when it comes to dealing with digital assets, intermediate security, and how everyone should protect their digital assets.

                                    Both Alex and Tony have a long history as digital asset investors and their experience has led them on a very successful journey. However, digital asset security ultimately depends on the asset owner. As an owner, you can secure your assets and make them “safe”. Like most things related to crypto, it is up to you; there is no middle man or institution to ensure your valuables are secured.
                                    
                                    Having said this, wouldn’t it be best to stay informed? How can you address this and protect your digital assets?</p>

                                <p>Women have been under-represented in private equity for as long as the industry has been around. Are there encouraging signs that the glass ceiling is cracking? This Linqto Learn investigates by sitting down and speaking with the women who've been through it all and have opinions.

                                    Let's have a look at the numbers... Recent academic and industry research suggests that women hold just 16% of senior posts in investment banking and 12% in asset management. In the world of private equity, it's estimated that around 11% of senior executives are female. If you exclude the legal, HR, and investor relations departments, which are thought to be more female-friendly, then the percentage of women working as senior PE executives is even lower.
                                    
                                    Why so few? This Linqto Learn is here to understand the underrepresentation of women and the challenges faced by women in the tech industry, both on the operating side and on the financing side. This Linqto Learn is intended to empower women with financial literacy and access to experts and investments. You do not need to be accredited to participate.</p>

                                <p>Did you know that to earn $1000 / month on Spotify, a musician needs around 120k streams per month and hold all the track’s rights? Spotify pays between $0.006 and $0.0084 per play. For musicians, it’s hard to find innovative ways to build a career. Well, Blockchain is finally gearing up to shake the traditional music industry. It aims to decentralize music creators and provide a level of control that has been missing. 

                                    How will independent artists, record labels, music rights owners, and fans take advantage of this new paradigm? Audiochain’s CEO, Paula Reina, breaks down the many areas blockchain is providing a positive outlook on selling direct-to-fans and the tools missing from the current markets.</p>

                                    We’re sitting down with David Uhryniak, Director of Blockchain at TRON, a leading blockchain platform dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via decentralized applications (DApps). TRON completed full decentralization in December 2021 and has become a purely community-governed DAO. In the stable coin space, TRON has a market share of approximately 25% of the entire stable coin market. That’s an enormous mantle to hold. David identifies key opportunities within the broad blockchain ecosystem and ensures TRON is positioned to act on all the opportunities.

                                <p>Is there a need for mass crypto adoption? Arguable. However, if and when it happens, people will be grateful that this transition has happened. Similar to the internet, you didn’t know you needed it until you had it, after that, there’s no return. In fact, it’s hard to imagine that there was a before. Crypto technologies may be one of the most imperative yet least recognized components of our evolving digital world. Crypto is laying the foundations for a self-sovereign financial system, an open creator economy, and a universal digital representation and ownership layer via NFTs. In this Linqto Learn we sit down with Mark Anthony Hill, co-founder of crypto investment fund Richmark Capital, to discuss how crypto gaming is the on-ramp to mass crypto adoption.

                                    It doesn’t matter if the market is up or down, people will play video games. There are presently over 2.7bn video game players globally, that’s 1 in 3 people. Throughout the history of gaming, despite the ebbs and flows of trends both ephemeral and sticky, the concept of video games and virtual environments has reached an unimaginable audience. The value derived from gaming is community and access – take a look at Doge, which has a following of like-minded thinkers, because ultimately games are great at tying communities together through experience.
                                    
                                    We will touch on the value proposition of various gaming companies and how investors should be evaluating gaming projects. We’ll deep dive into Gala Games studio, which is tapping into the play-to-earn space by combining crypto and NFTs to add value and provide an excellent user experience. Gala is the medium of exchange between people who are playing the games and the primary principle is that it allows you to own your own content. We’ll get into what that means but the key takeaway to recognize before this session is the sheer scale of opportunity that’s around the corner and we need to know what that looks like and why it exists. A fascinating aspect of these technologies is recognizing the ability with which virtual game worlds can actually level the economic playing field globally. Don’t underestimate how quickly word-of-mouth can spread across communities as more people stumble across these opportunities. We’ve heard hollow echoes of ‘banking the unbanked’ throughout the crypto industry for years, but what if this is how it manifests? What if games, leading the virtual economy, are the trojan horse for empowering billions with blockchain and crypto.
                                </p>

                                <p>Defi has opened up finance and provided us all with access to a whole new set of tools. It’s about power to the people and arguably the best bank you’ll ever have. But what about applying the decentralization philosophy elsewhere? There are areas within the economy that haven't seen the shift towards digitization, tokenization, or representation of Web3. These are markets that people are nascent about but are potentially massive. So what are they? What is coming next in the digital asset space that can have a parabolic growth curve? This team will look ahead and predict the unlocking of liquidity in markets that have historically been undercapitalized…

                                    Here are some verticals that will be discussed:
                                    
                                    Decentralized real estate? We’ll be talking about opening up real estate investment opportunities given the current environment via digitization and tokenization. In 2021 banks and PE firms bought 1 in 7 properties in the US - there’s centralization and inflation problem and blockchain and tokenization could solve this. We’ll discuss how.
                                    
                                    The decentralization of media and communication? Rights to music and movies? What happens when you remove the intermediary company? What happens when we apply NFTs and DAOs here - an entire business model is potentially turned on its head transforming the concept of ownership as we know it…</p>

                                <p>Cryptocurrencies have the potential to reshape the financial world as we know it. In fact, they have the potential to question the very existence of traditional financial infrastructure. But what does the landscape look like? How should we be researching? What are the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies? How do you decide which one to invest in? What about cold wallets? What is the underlying value of the various crypto assets?

                                    We invited none other than Brad Kimes and DAI to walk us through Crypto 101. We’ll talk about why Bitcoin is equivalent to the first cell phone and why Ethereum is the AOL of crypto. We’ll discuss proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and consensus protocols. In fact, we’ll take a step back and ask what actually is staking? We’ll look at the core tenets of each cryptocurrency; what is the tech, what is the company behind it if there is one, what partnerships do they have, what problem are they solving? How long has it been around? What stage of application is it in? Is it being adopted by banks, countries, payment networks? Then philosophically we’ll ask why this tech even exists anyway.
                                    
                                    What about security? What’s the risk? Find out why this moment we are in today is similar to the early days of the stock market where stocks and bonds would be issued in paper form and you’d have to store them in your safe at home. Find out the benefits and downsides of cold storage vs. staying on an exchange…
                                    
                                    This is everything you need to know about the crypto landscape from these two crypto gurus, meanwhile, we’ll be playing devil's advocate. Sit tight</p>

                                <p>We all too well know that the financial services industry must move beyond what’s already in place to build a proper cross-border payment network. Today’s infrastructure is centered on outdated technology that incurs high fees, lacks transparency, and is unimaginably slow. This infrastructure was largely built before the internet to process cross-border payments - in short, it’s not nearly fit for the modern world. And so, we’ve hit an inflection point in the financial services industry.

                                    At its core Ripple offers an alternative to the old-school SWIFT rail; it uses its own consensus protocol and aims to make cross-border payments almost instantly. It’s designed to make it possible to connect different payment systems. This allows you to move money in different denominations quickly.
                                    
                                    By leveraging the XRP ledger, you can create a system that makes interactions among participants simple, smoother, and more transparent, whilst decreasing costs and transaction times. XRP boasts on-demand liquidity, meaning using XRP as a go-between-transactions can be made with each side sending and receiving their native currency.
                                    
                                    When you add DAOs into this mix, philosophically, you are creating a new kind of freedom. So, what’s on the horizon? What are the blind spots? Are there blind spots? We sit down with Jennifer Arcuri and Victoria Smith to find out more…</p>

                                <p>Avalanche, the proof of stake Layer blockchain has a market cap of 23bn with 245m circulating tokens. It’s a truly decentralized platform that has seen enormous growth, it now tallies about 1.8m users, with about 800,000 monthly activities. The market is obviously seeing the value of a fast, cheap, reliable blockchain. But why should we care? Where is this whole decentralized movement going and what should we be paying attention to? We sit down with Emin Gun Sirer, the CEO of AvaLabs, the company behind Avalanche to discuss the state of crypto markets and why and how Ava Labs will digitize all things.

                                    Emin Gun Sirer, until recently, was a professor of computer science at Cornell University. He is one of the main people that advanced the science and engineering of blockchains in the last decade or so. Let’s call him the Blockfather. He is the distributed systems expert and has had the benefit of looking at blockchains from an interesting perspective; people come to academics right before they enter the market allowing him foresight on many booms. Avalanche protocol came out of Cornell University about a year ago and Gun argues that it is the best blockchain out there and the third biggest breakthrough in distributed systems…
                                    
                                    The first being classical protocols, the second being proof of work, the third being Avalanche. It’s based on a couple of ground-breaking ideas; one of them is a brand-new consensus protocol that scales and is FAST. The second idea behind it is its notion of subnets, it’s not a single monolithic, one size fits all solution, but it’s a solution that allows anyone to start their own blockchain with their own rules. This allows regulatory compliance to be built into the system, it allows institutions with high-value assets to put them on the blockchain, to digitize their valuable assets in a manner that is compliant with whatever jurisdiction they are in.
                                    
                                    The goal is not to compete with the dollar, it’s not to build a computer in the sky but rather it’s to digitize all things. They are an asset digitization platform and they have the architecture and scale necessary to tackle the 700tn worth of assets out there.</p>

                                    <p>At Linqto it’s incredibly important to us to support our community. This year we’ve had the privilege of supporting the following 14 organizations. We have been inspired by the impact these organizations have on disadvantaged young people whose lives can be enhanced and even transformed with the appropriate support. These people may go on to make their own positive contribution to society, thereby amplifying the impact of these charities. Linqto supports education, health, environment and an inclusive society, nationally and globally and we’ve had the privilege of supporting the following organizations.

                                    </p>
                                    <h4>JDRF – Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation </h4>
                                    
                                    <p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that strikes both children and adults suddenly. It has nothing to do with diet or lifestyle. There is nothing you can do to prevent it. And, at present, there is no cure. JDRF works tirelessly to find better treatments, preventions and ultimately, a cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and its complications through critical research. They have some of the best ratings for an organization focused on a single disease from charity watchdog groups and media. In 2012, Forbes named JDRF one of its five “All-Star” charities, based on its evaluation of their financial efficiency. 

                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Pacific Grove Arts Center</h4>
                                    <p>A local charity so Linqto can support its home town. PGAC is the home of the Peninsula Ballet Center. Since 1969, Pacific Grove Art Center has been a community based nonprofit seeking to enhance art appreciation and encourage the creation of art. With the desire to have art available to everyone, PGAC has held low cost classes, free exhibits, and offered reduced rent for artist’s studios for over 40 years. Emerging to established artists are professionally shown in their historic galleries, and large group shows can provide the first step into the art world for many. Through generous donations, grants, and hundreds of volunteered hours, the Art Center continues its mission today. 

                                    </p>

                                    <p>The National Park Foundation strives to ensure that all people are welcome and able to discover their own personal connections to parks.

                                    <p>St. Anthony Foundation is a social services agency in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco that offers a way out of poverty to the most vulnerable among us: seniors, veterans, the physically disabled, the mentally and addictively ill, the unemployed and underemployed. We were founded in 1950 by Fr. Alfred Boeddeker, a Franciscan priest, and for more than 60 years we have pursued our mission to “feed, heal, shelter, clothe and lift the spirits of those in need, and to create a society where all people flourish.” Through our many programs, we offer our guests a gateway to reclaim their sense of dignity, progress toward stability, and ultimately move out of poverty. In community with volunteers, donors and guests, we work on long-term solutions to poverty while meeting immediate, critical needs.

                                    <p>Delancey Street is the country’s leading residential self-help organization for former substance abusers, ex-convicts, homeless and others who have hit bottom.

Residents at Delancey Street range from teenagers to senior citizens, and include men and women and all races and ethnicities. The average resident has been a hard-core drug and alcohol abuser, has been in prison, is unskilled, functionally illiterate, and has a personal history of violence and generations of poverty.
